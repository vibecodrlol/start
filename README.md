## Structure
- `src/` â€” Main source files
	- `main.js` â€” Main JavaScript logic
	- `styles.css` â€” Styles
	- `js/modules/` â€” Modular JavaScript components
	- `js/lib/Sortable.min.js` â€” Local copy of SortableJS for drag-and-drop (required for Content Security Policy compliance)
	- `icons/` â€” Icons for the project

## Libraries

This project uses a local copy of [SortableJS](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable) (`src/js/lib/Sortable.min.js`) for drag-and-drop functionality in the quick links section. This is necessary because browser extension Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions prevent loading scripts from external CDNs. If you update or replace this library, ensure you use a local, minified version.

## Icons

The icons used in this extension were sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com), like the [main one](https://fontawesome.com/icons/house-chimney-window?f=classic&s=solid).

> **Note:** Font Awesome icons are licensed under the [Font Awesome Free License](https://fontawesome.com/license/free). Please ensure your usage complies with their terms.
